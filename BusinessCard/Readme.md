# 📇 Business Card App (Low-Fidelity Prototype)

This is a low-fidelity prototype of a **Business Card App** built using **Jetpack Compose** for Android. The app displays a digital business card containing a profile icon, name, title, and key contact information such as phone number, email, and social media handle—all styled in a clean, minimal layout.
